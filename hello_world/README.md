Tasks
0. Preprocessor
Filename: 0-preprocessor
Description: This script runs a C file through the preprocessor, which processes directives (such as #include and #define) before actual compilation. The output is saved into a specified result file.

1. Compiler
Filename: 1-compiler
Description: This script compiles a C file but does not perform linking. It generates an object file that can be linked later. This is useful for debugging or modular programming.

2. Assembler
Filename: 2-assembler
Description: This script generates the assembly code from a C code file. The resulting assembly code is saved in an output file, allowing for low-level inspection of the compiled code.
